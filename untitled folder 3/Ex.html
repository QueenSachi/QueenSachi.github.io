      Today is July 16 2018.This letter was written as a project in the girls who code program we dearly wished
      for and got into. Anyways, How are we? Have we reached our goals in Gaming?What are some of the sucesses we
      had? Right now i want to major in Game development. We have such a pashion for gaming that has just taken us
      to a whole new level of imagination.Did we go to college, if not what happend?Are we still with Fread Bear?
      It would be so nice if we are.If not did we find someone or stayed single?
      Now onto the important things XD.Are we where we want to Be? Beyond the simple things in life and all that has
      happened and all that we have gone threw good and bad. Have we reached the ultimite goal that we had?
      Remember that we should never regret a choice that we make. Mistakes happen and its a way to let us learn.
      Remember that Love does exsist and even in times where we don't feel it it's in the hands of God.
      That even if we arn't in church we have a root focused on God. That even if we do things that we don't
      really desire but benifits our life it is worth it. Remember that we always have a choice and not everyone will
      understand us. Remember that true friends are the people who are happy to see you succede.-Abidalys Rosa (17)
